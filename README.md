# Interactive-HTML5-Photo-Editor

# Image Upload & Export
Users can upload images via drag-and-drop or file input control and download the final edited result.

# Interactive Selection Tool
The editor supports image selection functionality. By default, the entire image is selected. Users can modify the selection area using mouse interactions (mouse down – mouse up), similar to the selection mechanism in Microsoft Paint.

# Interactive Crop
Users can crop a specific area of the image by selecting the desired region directly with the mouse.

# Apply Effects on Selected Area
Users can apply visual effects (e.g., grayscale, brightness, contrast, etc.) exclusively to the selected portion of the image.

# Proportional Image Scaling
The image can be resized while maintaining aspect ratio. The user provides either the new width or the new height, and the other dimension is calculated automatically.

# Add Text to Image
Users can overlay custom text onto the image, specifying:
Text content
Font size
Color
Position

# Dynamic Color Histogram
A color histogram is continuously displayed for the currently selected area, updating in real time as the selection changes.

# Move Selection
The selected area can be repositioned using the mouse while holding the Shift key.

# Delete Selection
The selected area can be cleared, turning all pixels within the selection to white.
